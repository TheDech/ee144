Communications
--------------

Please consider reaching out to me in the following preferred order.

1. **Office Hour**. Please wisely use the time at office hour, where
   I can give detailed explainations. 
   You can also send me an email to make an appointment, if you cannot make it to office hour.

2. **Piazza**. It is said that Piazza makes office hour 24hr/7days for students.
   If you have any questions/concerns offline, please ask in Piazza first.

   + It is good for others who have the same/similar questions. 

   + We can use multimedia materials to answer in Piazza, rather than plain text in emails.

   + You may get good answers/helps from your classmates as well, which is encouraged.
   
   + You can also ask private questions in Piazza, which are only visible to instructors.

3. **Emails**. It is hard to discuss technical questions through emails.
   However, I will try to get back to you ASAP or within 24 hours, unless I am traveling. 


Lab Section Style
------------------------

- Typically, lab tutorials and assignments will be posted on the website before lab starts.
  During lab section, you can work on these materials at your own pace, 
  and let me know if you have any questions or need help of it. 
  This is the typical style of lab section.

- Meanwhile, we will maintain two lists on the whiteboard, one for demo and the other for help.
  Please put your name on the corresponding list when needed. 
  I will take care of two lists alternately.
  It is good to organize things in this way because

  + It is good for me to remember your name.

  + It is fair for all students to get help on a first come-first served basis.

  + I may not be available right at the time you raise up your hand 
    (e.g., may be working on fixing a bug that a previous student just pointed out).


Submission and Grading
----------------------

- Some labs are required to submit your code via iLearn. 
  Please create a ReadMe.md or ReadMe.txt file along with your script 
  and explain briefly how to run your code. 
  Lab assignments are typically due at 11:59pm one week after assigned.

- Some labs are required to show demos to me. 
  During the demos, you may be asked a couple of questions to test your understanding
  of lab materials. Sample questions are given in the lab assignments.
  Please get prepared, otherwise you may lose some points.

- Attendance is required for all labs. However, 
  you may leave early if you have completed all lab materials.
  Please sign in and sign out when you enter/leave lab room.
  (There is a form near the door.) This lab rule is enforced by the department.

- Grading will be completed typically within one week after submission.
  You will get a list of deducted points (if any) indicating where 
  you lose points and why.


Academic Integrity
------------------

Discussions are encouraged between teams/individuals for the purpose of 
having better understanding of lab materials. However, each of you (your team)
has to work on your scripts independently after discussions. 
No copying of any form is allowed between each other. 

.. warning::

    All code submissions will be automatically checked for plagiarism in the system.
    If you borrowed some trivial modules/classes from the Internet,
    please mention this both in your code (by comments) and report/ReadMe file.
    Any violation of academic integrity will result in 0 score in lab assignment,
    and will be reported to the university.
