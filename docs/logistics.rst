Logistics
=========

Welcome
-------

This page introduces logistics for lab section only; 
please see syllabus for course overview and lecture/homework related logistics.

- Teaching Assistant: Hanzhe Teng
- Email: hteng007@ucr.edu
- Office Hour: TBD

Please **feel free** to contact me if you have any question.


Lab Organization
----------------

- Lab tutorials and assignments will be posted on the website before each lab starts.
  During lab sessions, you can work on these materials at your own pace, 
  and let me know if you have any question. 
  
- It is encouraged to go over lab materials before coming to the lab, such that you can 
  wisely/efficiently use the time during lab sessions and ask important questions to help you 
  finish (or at least figure out how to finish) the lab assignment by the end of the lab.

- Meanwhile, we will maintain two lists on the whiteboard, one for demo and the other for help.
  Please put your name on the corresponding list when needed. 
  I will take care of two lists alternately.
  It is good to organize things in this way because

  + It is good for me to remember your name.

  + It is fair for all students to get help on a first come first served basis.

  + I may not be available right at the time you raise up your hand 
    (e.g., may be working on fixing a bug that a previous student just pointed out).

- Due to online instruction, this year we may post lab materials at the beginning of each week
  and due by the end of each week. In Zoom, shared whiteboard and breakout rooms may be used
  for better organization. This will be finalized soon.


Submission and Grading
----------------------

- In some labs, it is required to submit your code via iLearn or Gradescope. 
  Please organize your code clearly and explain it by adding proper comments.
  Please also submit a lab report to document your approach. 
  A templete lab report will be provided.

- In some other labs, it is required to demo to me. 
  During the demo, some questions may be asked to test your understanding
  of lab materials. Sample questions may be given in lab assignments.
  Please get prepared, otherwise you may lose points.

- Attendance is required for all labs. However, 
  you may leave early if you have completed all lab materials.
  Please sign in and sign out when you enter/leave lab room.
  (There is a sign-in form near the door.) 
  This lab rule is enforced by the department.

- Lab assignments are typically due at 11:59pm one week after assigned, unless otherwise specified.
  Grading will be completed ASAP after submission. 
  You will get a detailed feedback indicating where you lost points and why.


Communications
--------------

Please consider reaching out to me in the following preferred order, regarding technical issues.

1. **Office Hour**. Please wisely use the time at office hour, during which
   I can give detailed explainations.
   You can also email me to schedule an appointment, if you cannot make it to office hour.

2. **Piazza**. It is said that Piazza makes office hour 24hr/7days for students.
   If you have any questions/concerns offline, please ask on Piazza first.

   + It is good for others who have the same/similar questions. 

   + We can use multimedia materials to interact on Piazza, rather than plain text in emails.

   + You may get good answers/helps from your classmates as well, which is encouraged.
   
   + You can ask private questions on Piazza if necessary, which are visible to instructors only.

3. **Emails**. It is hard to discuss technical questions through emails.
   However, I will try to get back to you ASAP. 
   
   + For course logistics and technical questions, Piazza (private question if necessary) is better than emails. 

   + For other queries (e.g., personal affairs), you are very welcome to send me an email. 


Academic Integrity
------------------

Discussions are encouraged between teams/individuals for the purpose of 
having a better understanding of lab materials. However, each of you (or your team)
should work on your code independently after discussions. 
No copying of any form is allowed between each other. 

.. warning::

  All code submissions will be automatically checked for plagiarism in the system.
  If you borrowed some trivial modules/classes from the Internet,
  please mention this both in your code (by comments) and lab report.
  Any violation of the rules of academic integrity will result in 0 score in the lab assignment,
  and will be reported to the university.


Lab Safety
----------

#. Safety is always the top priority.

   - No food or beverage allowed in the lab.
   - Report any suspicious cables, wires, etc.

#. Organize your station before you leave.

   - **Cut off all power supply (both robot base and NUC)**.
   - Organize wires, cables, etc.

#. Do not leave your personal information on the robot.

   - Create your own folder when you work, and delete code when you leave.
   - The robot is shared by two lab sections.

#. Do NOT make any changes to the wiring on the robot.

#. Please find your station according to your team number. 

   - In Tuesday lab, your station/robot number is your team number.
   - In Thursday lab, your station/robot number is your team number minus 10.

#. Please save the battery (recharging takes time), 
   and charge the robot if you do not have it running.

#. Please place your robot in the following way to prevent it 
   from accidentally dropping down to the ground.
